# CS-350


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving?

Throughout this class, I learned how to use and understand the TI CS 3220 launchpad and the use of code composer to work hand in hand with the launchpad. There were many 
applications which I learned such as the development of morse code, LED lights generating, and a working thermostat. 

What did you do particularly well?

I believe I was able to develop the code very well as I was able to accomplish the tasks for example the morse code of 'SOS'. 

Where could you improve?

I need to improve on my development of the diagrams, but I have always had trouble in developing a diagram. I also ran into turning in work late, but it was more of my current 
career having major events occur which did not allow it to be in unity with this term.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

Using resources such as the walkthrough and other resources besidese the ones given in a course help me alot. I was able find resources to break down diagrams and to follow the 
walkthroughs helped me visually and kinesthetic learn by following the steps and seeing the work come to life.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

A skill which will help me later that I learned from this class that I did not learn from any class yet was seeing how software can affect a hardware device such as the LED 'SOS'
developed in the Morse Code project.
